🐔 Early Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project is an AI-powered system for early detection of poultry diseases using deep learning. It combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification with a simple web interface for uploading poultry images and predicting potential diseases.

🚀 Features

 * 🧠 Deep Learning Model trained with TensorFlow/Keras

 * 📊 Generates accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix plots

 * 🖼️ Image Upload & Prediction through a user-friendly web interface

 * 🐦 Supports multiple poultry disease classes (e.g., Cocci, NCD, Salmonella, Healthy)

 * 🔮 Provides prediction confidence and detailed results

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/poultry-disease-detection.git
cd poultry-disease-detection

2️⃣ Install dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and install required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Sample requirements.txt:

tensorflow
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
flask

3️⃣ Train the model
python training.py


This will generate:

disease_model.h5 (trained model)

Accuracy & loss plots

Confusion matrix report

4️⃣ Test the model
python testing.py

5️⃣ Run the web app
python app.py


Then open http://localhost:5000
 in your browser to use the web interface.

🎯 Example Predictions

Input: Poultry image

Output: Disease classification (e.g., Cocci) with confidence score
